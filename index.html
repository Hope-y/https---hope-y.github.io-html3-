<p>From Vox articels here some qoutes
<blockquote>
Compared to dogs, scientists have found, cats don't seem to have the same sort of emotional attachment to their owners, and show genuine affection far less often than you might think.
Further, they're an environmental disaster, killing literally billions of birds in the US every year — many of them from endangered species.</blockquote>

And another: 
&nbsp<cite>cats are selfish, unfeeling, environmentally devastating creatures.</cite>

<blockquote>
You will never eat alone again!  There’s nothing like having a dog in your face while you are trying to eat dinner at night. 
If they can get close enough (like if you are eating on the couch) you may even be lucky enough to get a little dog drool on your plate. 
Or if you have a brave dog, they will just take a bite without you even offering.  It happens.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With mischievous eyes and sweet faces, ferrets are undeniably adorable. They are a small size and can provide your family with a sweet long-term pet...
They will entertain you endlessly with their antics and will happily play with ferret toys. Watching ferrets play for the sheer joy of it is guaranteed to lift your mood...
Ferrets can be trained to go in a box, though not to the same extent as cats and there are bound to be a few accidents. Most ferrets can be fairly reliably trained to use a litter box in and out of their cages. </blockquote>
